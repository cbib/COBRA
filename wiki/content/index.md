#Overview

Plant viruses cause an estimated 50 billion € loss worldwide per year. Viral diseases represent one of the most
limiting factors in European crop production having negative effects on the quantity and quality of foodstuffs. 
The recent identification of plant factors required for the virus infection cycle, together with the development 
of functional genomic tools in several economically important crops, offer novel opportunities to protect crop plants 
against viral diseases. However, current candidate genes are few, and in the better-studied case (i.e. eIF4E, 
eIF4G) their proteins interact mainly with the same viral factor. This is a major limitation that compromises 
the durability of resistances, because resistance depends on the introduction of a single trait implicating one 
single viral counterpart. The scope of COBRA is to intensify applied and fundamental research on plant/virus 
interactions in order to diversify targets for resistance gene pyramiding strategies and to match the research 
outputs with industry and breeding applications.

COBRA benefits from multidisciplinary research teams involving genomics, bio-informatics, population genetics, 
molecular biology, virology and plant breeding. It focuses on three major crops, barley for cereals, tomato for 
vegetables and Prunus species for fruit trees. The originality of COBRA is to test the generic mode of interference 
of plant viruses, from annual plants to perennials and from dicotyledons to monocotyledons and use this information 
to implement complex and durable resistance in any crop species.

COBRA is built on five transdisciplinary workpackages (WPs). The objective of WP1 is to build an exhaustive and 
comprehensive database of plant-virus interaction networks for the three crops of interest. It relies on a close 
interactive collaboration between experts in virology, genetics, breeding and bioinformatics. Such a database 
facilitates identification of new host susceptibility genes (S-genes) that could serve as resistance genes 
when mutated. In WP2, the biological relevance of some of the interactors unraveled in WP1 or by COBRA partners 
will be validated, demonstrating that they are not only plant/virus interacting factors but they are susceptibility 
factors encoded by bona fide S-genes. The goal of WP3 is to screen for alleles of resistance for the S-genes 
identified above. Alleles of resistance to viral infection will be searched among mutagenised tomato, barley and 
peach collections. Germplasm collections of those three species will also be surveyed as well as core collections 
representative of their diversity in order to implement marker assisted selection and association studies for 
resistance to crop viruses. Any valuable plant material will be immediately transferred to crop breeding programs. 


In year 1, COBRA focuses on the search for variants of strong candidate S-genes already validated or patented by 
the project’s partners. The high throughput platforms set-up for the few above candidates will then serve to screen 
for variants of candidates validated in WP2 (year 2) before targeting hundreds of candidates highlighted in WP1 (year 3). 
In the fourth WP, we plan to decipher two independent host pathways that poty and potexviruses are hijacking in order 
to complete their viral infectious cycles. Extra biological information will be generated in order to optimize in WP3 
the search for virus resistant variants. Finally, WP5 is aimed at selecting among the above interactors, host proteins 
as candidates-of- choice for gene pyramiding. The purpose here is to provide knowledge on the viral factor(s) that 
determine(s) the breaking of the resistance provided by candidate genes identified in the above WPs and to evaluate 
the durability of the resistance conferred by the new candidate genes prior to transfer to crop species.
In conclusion, COBRA is expected to provide new targets for resistance to plant viruses, distinct from the well- 
described mechanism related to translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4G. This will allow the selection of 
new cultivars in tomato, barley and stone fruit trees combining different mechanisms of resistance for sustainable 
virus protection. COBRA will also establish high throughput platforms of transfer to crop species based on the 
construction of a non-exhaustive database of plant-virus interactors and the use of next generation sequencing 
approaches.
